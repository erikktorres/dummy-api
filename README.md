dummy-api
=========


This exists to show the best practices for Tidepool code. Eventually it will be an example of how we design APIs, write code, do documentation, do testing, and deploy reliably.

## Running it locally

For ease of test/debug, you can run this under nodemon, which is why there's a Procfile. You simply have to run nodemon from the top level folder and it will Do The Right Thing. The default port is 
port 80, so chances are that to run locally you'll want to set the DUMMY_PORT environment variable
to a port you'd like to use for testing. For example, ```export DUMMY_PORT=7887```
